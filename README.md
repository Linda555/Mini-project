(sleep duration, physical activity), and psychological
indicators (stress levels, consultation history). 

Method
A Random Forest model was employed to rank feature
importance, while XGBoost provided classification
accuracy for low, medium, and high severity levels.
XGBoost is good to to get high performance in
predictive models were there is imbalances in the data.
Random Forest was selected for its robustness in
handling small datasets, ensuring reliable feature
importance rankings despite potential limitations in
sample size. Statistical correlation analyses were
conducted to validate the relationships identified by
the model, ensuring robustness in the result.
